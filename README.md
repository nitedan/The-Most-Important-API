gRPC
Title: Google Remote Procedure Call
Abbreviation: gRPC
Short description: A high-performance RPC framework for microservices
Long description: gRPC is a modern open-source RPC framework that can be used to develop distributed applications. It is based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers and provides a number of features that make it ideal for microservices and other distributed architectures.
Joke:
A gRPC developer is so fast, they can call a remote procedure before the other developer has even finished writing it.
Example:
A ride-sharing company uses gRPC to communicate between its various services, such as the rider app, driver app, and dispatch system. When a rider requests a ride, the rider app sends a request to the dispatch system. The dispatch system then sends a request to the driver app to find a driver who is available to pick up the rider. Once a driver is found, the dispatch system sends a message to the rider app and the driver app to connect them. The rider app and the driver app then use gRPC to communicate with each other throughout the ride.
WebSockets
Title: WebSocket Protocol
Abbreviation: WS
Short description: A protocol for full-duplex communication between a web client and server.
Long description: WebSockets is a protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a web client and server. This means that both the client and server can send and receive messages at the same time. This is in contrast to HTTP, which is half-duplex, meaning that the client and server can only send or receive messages one at a time.
WebSockets is a very efficient protocol, and it is often used for real-time applications, such as chat applications, gaming applications, and financial trading applications.
Joke:
A WebSockets developer is so excited about real-time communication, they can't even wait for the punchline.
Example:
A real-time chat application uses WebSockets to allow users to send and receive messages instantly. When a user sends a message, the message is sent to the server. The server then sends the message to all of the users who are connected to the chat room. The users then receive the message and can see it in the chat room window.
MQTT
Title: Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
Abbreviation: MQTT
Short description: A lightweight messaging protocol designed for machine-to-machine communication.
Long description: MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol that is designed for machine-to-machine communication. It is a popular choice for IoT applications, as it is very efficient and can handle large volumes of data.
MQTT is a publish-subscribe protocol, which means that devices can subscribe to different topics and receive messages when those topics are published to. This makes it ideal for applications where devices need to be able to receive updates from other devices in real time.
Joke:
An MQTT developer is so good at machine-to-machine communication, they can even talk to their coffee maker.
Example:
A smart home system uses MQTT to communicate between its various devices, such as the thermostat, lights, and security system. The thermostat can subscribe to the topic "temperature" and receive messages when the temperature changes. The lights can subscribe to the topic "brightness" and receive messages when the brightness level changes. The security system can subscribe to the topic "alarm" and receive messages when the alarm is triggered.
REST
Title: Representational State Transfer
Abbreviation: REST
Short description: An architectural style for designing web services.
Long description: REST is an architectural style for designing web services that is based on the idea of resources and states. Resources are things that can be represented in a web service, such as users, products, or orders. States are the different ways in which resources can be represented. For example, a user resource could be in a "logged in" state or a "logged out" state.
REST APIs are typically very easy to use and develop for, and they are the most popular type of API in use today.
Joke:
A REST developer is so good at designing APIs, they can even make a joke about SOAP.
Example:
A social media API uses REST to allow users to post and retrieve updates, as well as follow and unfollow other users. When a user wants to post an update, they send a POST request to the API with the text of the update. The API then creates a new update and returns a response with the update's ID. When a user wants to retrieve their updates, they send a GET request to the API. The API then returns a response with a list of the user's updates.
GraphQL
Title: GraphQL Query Language
Abbreviation: GraphQL
Short description: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
Long description: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. This is in contrast to traditional REST APIs, which require clients to request specific resources, even if they only need a subset of the data that is returned.
GraphQL is a very flexible and powerful API query language, and it is becoming increasingly popular for complex applications.
Joke:
A GraphQL developer is so good at fetching data, they can even get the punchline of a joke before the setup.
Example:
A mobile app uses GraphQL to fetch the user's profile data, as well as the posts of the users they follow. The app sends a single GraphQL query to the API, requesting the following data:
•	The user's name, email, and profile picture.
•	The posts of the users the user follows, including the post ID, title, and content.
The API then returns a single response with all of the requested data. The app can then display the data to the user without having to make any additional requests.
SOAP
Title: Simple Object Access Protocol
Abbreviation: SOAP
Short description: A XML-based protocol for exchanging information between applications.
Long description: SOAP is a XML-based protocol for exchanging information between applications. It is a well-established protocol that is widely supported, but it can be complex to use and develop for.
SOAP is often used for enterprise applications, where security and reliability are important.
Joke:
A SOAP developer is so good at writing XML, they can even make it funny.
Example:
An ERP system uses SOAP to communicate with its various modules, such as the accounting module, CRM module, and inventory module. When the accounting module wants to create a new invoice, it sends a SOAP request to the ERP system with the invoice data. The ERP system then creates the new invoice and returns a response with the invoice ID. When the CRM module wants to retrieve a customer's contact information, it sends a SOAP request to the ERP system with the customer ID. The ERP system then retrieves the customer's contact information and returns it in a SOAP response.
